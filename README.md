## Hi there 👋
💡 I offer async code reviews and repo feedback via GitHub Sponsors (priority responses, no meetings).


Tier 1 — $10/month: Supporter


Support my development work and open-source projects. Sponsors help me continue building, documenting, and maintaining repos like this one.

🔵 Tier 2 — $25/month: Priority Feedback (MAIN TIER)

Priority asynchronous feedback on your repository, README, or a focused technical question. I’ll provide clear, actionable guidance on structure, clarity, and overall quality. No meetings or live calls.

🟣 Tier 3 — $50/month: Monthly Code Review 


One focused async code review per month covering structure, readability, and maintainability. Feedback is delivered via GitHub comments or a written summary. No feature development or live sessions.
